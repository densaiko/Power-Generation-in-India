# Power Generation in India - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### This notebook is using plotly which will not show the plotly chart in Github so I recommend you to use and click [NB viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/densaiko/Power_Generation_in_India/blob/master/Power%20Generation%20in%20India%20-%20EDA.ipynb)
- Connecting the population in India into the actual and estimated power generation
- Understanding the connection between how much power is generated with the total population
- Understanding the plan of India government to keep and even increase the energy generation in India

# Quickstart
This command is used to install plotly before you run the plotly function
`pip install plotly==4.9.0`

Here is the module that I used
